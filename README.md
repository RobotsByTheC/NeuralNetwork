# A Java neural network library
### For creating and training a feed-forward backpropagation neural network. 

This library is mostly a Java port of [Hunter Park's C++ neural network library](https://github.com/faust1706/Neural-Network), but I have fixed a few bugs and added a few features.

The neural network implementation is located in `NeuralNetwork` and some example/test code is located in `NeuralNetworkTest`.
